    <div class="main">
      <button class="accordion">Action</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <a href="" class="middle">Action</a>
        <p>Movies in the action genre are fast-paced and include a lot of action like fight scenes, chase scenes, and slow-motion shots. They can feature superheroes, martial arts, or exciting stunts. These high-octane films are more about the execution of the plot rather than the plot itself. Action movies are meant to be thrilling to watch and leave audience members on the edge of their seats. Cop movies, disaster films, and some spy films all fall under the action category.</p>
        <h4>Reveal below for my Recommendation</h4>
        <p class="reveal" id="reveal-action">Avengers - Endgame</p>

      <button class="accordion">Comedy</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <a href="" class="middle">Comedy</a>
        <p>Comedy films are funny and entertaining. The films in this genre center around a comedic premise—usually putting someone in a challenging, amusing, or humorous situation they’re not prepared to handle. Good comedy movies are less about making constant jokes, and more about presenting a universally relatable, real-life story with complex characters who learn an important lesson. Mockumentary, dark comedy (or black comedy), romantic comedy, parody/spoof, and slapstick comedy are all examples of comedy subgenres.</p>

      <button class="accordion">Drama</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <a href="" class="middle">Drama</a>
        <p>The drama genre features stories with high stakes and a lot of conflicts. They’re plot-driven and demand that every character and scene move the story forward. Dramas follow a clearly defined narrative plot structure, portraying real-life scenarios or extreme situations with emotionally-driven characters. Films that fall into drama sub-genres include historical drama, romantic drama, teen drama, medical drama, docudrama, and film noir.</p>

      <button class="accordion">Fantasy</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <a href="" class="middle">Fantasy</a>
        <p> Films in the fantasy genre feature magical and supernatural elements that do not exist in the real world. Although some films juxtapose a real-world setting with fantastical elements, many create entirely imaginary universes with their own laws, logic, and populations of imaginary races and creatures. Like science fiction films, fantasy films are speculative but are not tied to reality or scientific fact. High fantasy, fairy tales, and magical realism are all fantasy subgenres.</p>

      <button class="accordion">Horror</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <a href="" class="middle">Horror</a>
        <p>Horror films feature elements that leave people with an overwhelming sense of fear and dread. Horror movies often include serial killers or monsters as persistent, evil antagonists to play on viewers’ fears or nightmares. Audiences who love the horror genre seek out these movies specifically for the adrenaline rush produced by ghosts, gore, monsters, and jump-scares. Films that fall into the horror sub-genres include ghost stories, gothic horror movies, science fiction horror movies, supernatural movies, dark fantasy movies, psychological horror movies, and slasher movies.</p>

      <button class="accordion">Mystery</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <a href="" class="middle">Mystery</a>
        <p>Mystery films are all about the puzzle, and often feature a detective or amateur sleuth who is trying to solve it. Mystery films are full of suspense, and the protagonist searches for clues or evidence throughout the movie, piecing together events and interviewing suspects to solve the central question. Hardboiled noirs and police procedurals are two subcategories that often fall under the mystery genre.</p>

      <div class="panel">
        <a href="" class="middle">Romance</a>
        <p>Romance films are love stories. They center around two protagonists exploring some of the elements of love like relationships, sacrifice, marriage, obsession, or destruction. Romance movies sometimes feature hardships like illness, infidelity, tragedy, or other obstacles for the love interests to overcome. Romantic comedies, gothic romance, and romantic action are some popular romance subgenres.</p>

        <a href="" class="middle">Thriller</a>
        <p>Thrillers expertly blend mystery, tension, and anticipation into one exciting story. Successful thrillers are well-paced, often introducing red herrings, divulging plot twists, and revealing information at the exact right moments to keep the audience intrigued. Thrillers often include a “ticking clock” aspect, where the stakes are set against a finite amount of time. Crime films, political thrillers, and techno-thrillers are all featured in the thriller genre.</p>

      <button class="accordion">Western</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <a href="" class="middle">Western</a>
        <p>Westerns tell the tale of a cowboy or gunslinger pursuing an outlaw in the Wild West. The main character is often seeking revenge and will face off with the criminal in a duel or shootout at the end. Westerns are vivid productions set in the American West—such as the desert, mountains, or plains—that can inspire and inform the characters and the action. Spaghetti westerns, space westerns, and sci-fi westerns are all subgenres within the Western category.</p>
